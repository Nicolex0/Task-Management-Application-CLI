# TASK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION CLI

## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Manager Application, a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline organizational task management.
This application enables users to add, remove, and assign tasks to various users, while users can view their assigned tasks, find tasks by priority and due date, and list all tasks.
Our goal is to enhance productivity and task organization, making it easier for teams to work efficiently and effectively.
